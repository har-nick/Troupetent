# Troupetent

A Bandcamp client using Kotlin Multiplatform.

No ads. No tracking. Questionable quality control.

## Supporting Development

As the sole developer, I work on Troupetent in my spare time for free.

You can support this development by making pull requests, or donating to my [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/harnick).

## About

Troupetent originally started as an Android application for a university project.

Since I'm never content, it's being rebuilt as a multiplatform application with [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/mobile/).

## Features

Currently supports syncing with your Bandcamp account, and not much else.

Planned features are listed in the [Projects](https://github.com/har-nick/troupetent/projects?query=is:open) tab.

## Installation

Release builds are uploaded in the [Release](https://github.com/har-nick/troupetent/releases) section and to F-Droid.

Alternatively, clone and build the project yourself to get updates quicker.

I also record my findings on Bandcamp's API in a separate repo. You can find it [here](https://github.com/har-nick/bandcamp-api-docs/wiki) if you're curious!
